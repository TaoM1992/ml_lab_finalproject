# University of San Francisco's Machine Learning Laboratory MSDS 699 Spring 2021: Final Project -- Modeling Earthquake Damage 

### Project Goal: 
Using a historical data about earthquake impacts to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. 
There are 3 grades of the damage:

- 1 represents low damage
- 2 represents a medium amount of damage
- 3 represents almost complete destruction

### Data Introduction: 
The data was collected through surveys by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, which works under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. 
This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

### Data Description:
There are 39 columns and 260601 observations in this data. The target variable y is earthquake damage grades.
